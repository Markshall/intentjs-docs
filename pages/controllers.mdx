# Controllers

Controllers are the classes responsible for processing the incoming requests and returning requests to the client.

It's prupose is to receive a specific request, perform some business logic and return a response back to the client. 
For the server to know which controller will be handling which requests is made possible by `routing` mechanism.

Controllers can group related request handling logic in a class. For example, `UserController` class can handle all incoming
requests related to users.

## Writing Controllers
To quickly generate a new controller, you can run the `make:controller` command. By default, all of the controllers
are stored in the `app/http/controllers` directory.

```bash
node intent make:controller user
```

This will create a new controller file named `userController` inside `app/http/controllers` directory. Let's take a look
at it.

```ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('/users/')
export class UserController {
  constructor() {}

  @Get('')
  async create() {
    return 'Hello with an intent!';
  }
}
```

For a class to be registered as a controller, it needs to be anotated with `@Controller` decorator from `@nestjs/common`. In this class, we will define our various routes.

## Routing

If you have used `express` in the past, you would remember how the routes were defined in the `express` servers. For example,

```js
// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello world')
})
```

In Intent, you can define the same route in your controller, just like below.

```ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import {Req, Res, Request, Response } from '@intentjs/core';

@Controller('/user/')
export class UserController {
  constructor() {}

  @Get('')
  async get() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
}
```

The `@Get` decorator before the `get` method tells Intent to bind all requests which come to `GET /users` to this method. 
So whenever the client pings `GET /users` they will receive `hello world` as response. 

The method will return a 200 status code and the response, which is a string.

You can also add a subpath in the HTTP request method decorator, for example `@Get('/all')` will bind `GET /users/all` to the method.

## Request Object

If you are building an endpoint, you will need to also access the request object which let's you get the details from the request.
To do so, you can make use of the `@Req` decorator and `Request` class from `@intentjs/core` package.

Intent comes with it's own `Request` utility which is more powerful than those available, you can read more about the `Request` objects [here](/requests).
But if you would like to use NestJS decorators, feel free to do so.

For example, let's say you want to build an endpoint which creates customer. For this, you will need to create a `POST` handler.

```ts
import { Req, Request } from '@intentjs/core';
import { Controller, Delete, Get, Patch, Post, Put } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('/users')
export class UserController {
  constructor() {}

  @Get('')
  async index(@Req() req: Request) {
    console.log(req.all());
  }
}
```

## Resources

In the previous section, we created an endpoint to fetch list of all users (GET route). But in real world scenario, you will need 
multiple endpoints to create, update, delete data.

Let's take an example how this looks like.

```ts
import { Req, Request } from '@intentjs/core';
import { Controller, Delete, Get, Patch, Post, Put } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('/users')
export class UserController {
  constructor() {}

  @Get('')
  async index(@Req() req: Request) {}

  @Post('')
  async create(@Req() req: Request) {}

  @Put(':id')
  async update(@Req() req: Request) {}

  @Patch(':id')
  async patch(@Req() req: Request) {}

  @Delete(':id')
  async delete(@Req() req: Request) {}
}
```

The above controller, will create following endpoints along with their respective method

|Method|Endpoint|
|---|---|
|GET|`/users`|
|POST|`/users`|
|PUT|`/users/:id`|
|PATCH|`/users/:id`|
|DELETE|`/users/:id`|

List of all of the available standard HTTP methods: `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, `@Patch`, `@Delete()`, `@Options()`, `@Head()`. In addition, `@All()` defines an endpoint that handles all of them.

## Route Wildcards

By default, out of the box Intent also supports Pattern based routes as well. For instance, the asterisk `*` is used as wildcard.

```ts
@Get('ab*cd')
findAll() {
  return 'This route uses a wildcard';
}
```

The `ab*cd` route path will match abcd, ab_cd, abecd, and so on. The characters ?, +, *, and () may be used in a route path, and are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen ( -) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

## Status Code

By default, all of the HTTP Methods except `@Post()` return `200 OK` status code, only `POST` method returns a `201 Created` status code. You can easily change this behavious by adding the `@HttpCode` decorator at the handler level.

```ts
import { HttpCode } from '@nestjs/common';

@Delete()
@HttpCode(204)
async delete() {
  return;
}
```

## Headers
To specify a custom response header, you can use `@Header` decorator or a library-specific response object.

```ts
import { Header } from '@nestjs/common';

@Post()
@Header('Cache-Control', 'none')
async create() {
  return 'This action adds a new user';
}
```

## Redirection
To redirect a response to a specific url, you can use the `@Redirect()` decorator or a library specific reponse object.

`@Redirect()` takes two arguments, `url` and `statusCode`, both are optional. The default value of statusCode is 302 (Found) if omitted.

```ts
@Get()
@Redirect('https://tryintent.com', 301)
```

## Route Parameters

If you wish to accept dynamic data as part of your request, you can make use of the route parameters, for example `GET /users/1` to get user with id 1.
In order to define routes with parameters, we can add route parameter tokens in the part of the route to capture the dynamic value at that position in the request URL.

<Callout type="info">
Route with parameters should always be declared after any static paths. This prevents the parameterized paths from intercepting the routes destined for static paths.
</Callout>

```ts
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Req() req: Request) {
  const id = req.input('id');
  return `This action returns a user with id ${id}.`;
}
```

## Sub-Domain Routing

The `@Controller` decorator can take a `host` option to require that the HTTP host of the incoming requests should match the specific value.

```ts
@Controller({host: 'users.tryintent.com'})
export class UserController {
}
```

Similar to route `path`, the `host` option can also take tokenized strings to capture the dynamic value at that position in the host name.

```ts
@Controller({host: ':tenantId.tryintent.com'})
export class UserController {
}
```

If you would like to access these host params, you can make use of the `HostParams` decorator.

## Request Payload

There are multiple ways you can retrieve the payload from the request, you can either make use of the `req.all()` method from `Request` object 
or alternatively make use of the `@Payload()` decorator to retrieve the payload.

```ts
@Controller('/users')
export class UserController {
  constructor() {}

  @Get('')
  async index(@Req() req: Request) {
    const payload = req.all();
  }

  @Post('')
  async create(@Payload() payload: CreateUserDto) {
    console.log(payload);
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
We recommend using `@Payload` decorator as it provides a typed safe object, whereas `req.all` only returns a POJO.
</Callout>

## Registering Controller
For Intent to know, you will need to register the `UserController` inside the `AppModule`. This enables to scan all of the routes, and register them on the HTTP server.


```ts
import { Module } from '@intentjs/common';
import { UserController } from './http/controllers/user';

@Module({
  controllers: [UserController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
