## What is Intent?

Intent is a web application framework built on top of [NestJS](https://nestjs.com). It _intends_ to provide declarative APIs to develop and ship sophisticated solutions. While NestJS provides great syntax and structure to your application, but it lacks many things which are needed to develop a good solution.&#x20;

In a real world scenario, it is likely that you will need many things like authentication, database integration, web views and what not. This is exactly what Intent wants to solve for you.

Intent strives to provide a good developer experience while providing powerful features like database integration, queue integration, event listeners, task scheduling etc.

Note - While Intent tries it's best to respect NestJS design principles in the best way possible, but sometimes it can be difficult. So, by default Intent follows the way which ensures maximum value for the community.

## Why Intent?

Intent is a web application framework for devs and teams who intends to build and ship complex yet sophisticated solutions to the world. It provides APIs which are declarative and customisable, while still keeping abstraction of unnecessary loads at it's best.

Intent provides necessary feature-integrations out of the box.

  Some features are delivered out-of-the-box and some you can integrate as you
  need them.

## **Installation**

Intent works best when you create your new application with Intent itself, to do so, simply run

```bash
npx create-intent-app
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, due to many integrations out of the box, integrating IntentJS in
  your NestJS application is not supported. If you would like to request it, you
  can do it here.
