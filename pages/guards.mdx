# Guards

A guard is an injectable class which has only single responsibility. Unlike Middlewares, Guards have context object, and can
determine which route handler will be running. You can use guards to verify the authenticity of a user, perform some role permission checks
and other security related stuff.

In Guards, we don't have any `next` method and just need to return `true` or `false` to evaluate. If you return `true`, the guards will move on to next handler
automatically, or else if you return `false` it would throw an `Forbidden 403` error by default.

## Writing Guards
To create a guard, you can run the `node intent make:guard AuthenticateJwt` command. This command will create a `AuthenticateJwt.ts` file inside `app/http/guards` directory. For example, following guard will be created

```ts
// update the code here.
import { IntentGuard } from '@libs/intent/rest/foundation/guards/baseGuard';
import { Request } from '@libs/intent/rest/foundation/request';
import { Response } from '@libs/intent/rest/foundation/response';

export class SampleGuard extends IntentGuard {
  async boot(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<boolean> {
    return true;
    // throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
  }
}
```

Along with the `request` and `response` object, guards also get a ``
